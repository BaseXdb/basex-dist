NAME
  basexclient - XML database system and XPath/XQuery processor (client mode)

SYNOPSIS
  basexclient [-npPU] [-dovVwz] [-cq] [file]

DESCRIPTION
  basexclient starts a basex(1) XML database client in order to connect to a
  running instance of basexserver(1).

  Per default basexclient tries to connect to a basexserver(1) running on localhost port 1984.

  Connecting to a basexserver(1) requires the knowledge of a username and its corresponding credentials.
  For user management refer to basexserver(1) or the BaseX Documentation Wiki (http://docs.basex.org/wiki/User_Management)

OPTIONS
  [file]     Execute the specified XQuery file.
  -b<pars>   Bind external variables to XQuery expression. Flag may be specified
             multiple times; key/value pairs are separated by equality signs (=)
             (-bv=example -q"declare variable $v external; $v")
  -c<cmd>    Launch database commands and skip interactive mode. The flag should be placed last, all remaining characters are interpreted as commands. Several commands can be separated by semicolons. (-c"list;info") 
  -d         Turn on debugging. Debugging information is output to standard error. 
  -n<name>   Specify the server name on which the server is running. (default: localhost, -nserver.basex.org)
  -o<file>   Command and query output is written to the specified <file>. 
  -p<num>    Specify the port on which the server is running. (default: 1984, -p9999)
  -P<pass>   Specify the user password (-Uadmin -Padmin)
  -q<expr>   Execute the specified string as XQuery expression. The flag should be placed last, as all remaining characters are interpreted as XQuery. (-q"doc('input')//head")
  -s<pars>   Specify parameters for serializing XQuery results; This flag may be specified multiple times; key/value pairs are separated by equality signs (=). (-smethod=text)
  -U<name>   Specify the user name (-Uadmin)
  -v         Process information is written to standard output.
  -V         Detailed query information is written to standard output, including compilation and profiling steps.		
  -w         By default, whitespaces around text nodes are chopped when a database is created. This flag can be specified to suppress chopping.		
  -z         Skip the serialization of XQuery results. This flag is useful for analyzing query plans.
