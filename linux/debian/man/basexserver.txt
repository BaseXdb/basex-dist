NAME
  basexserver - XML database system and XPath/XQuery processor (server mode)

SYNOPSIS
  basexserver [-cdinpSz] [stop]

DESCRIPTION
  basexserver starts the server mode of the native XML database system basex(1) on default port 1984.

OPTIONS
  A short description of option can be obtained from

    $ basexserver \-h

  or by browsing http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Command-Line_Options#HTTP_Server

USER MANAGEMENT
  On first startup a user 'admin' with default password 'admin' exists (make sure to change this)!

  Admin permissions are needed to execute one of the following processes.

  * Creating user 'test' with password 'test':

   > CREATE USER test test
  
  As global permissions valid options are 'none', 'read', 'write', 'create' and 'admin'.

  * Revoking all global permissions from user 'test':

   > GRANT none TO test

  Valid local permissions are 'none', 'read' and 'write'.

  * Granting write permission on database 'factbook' to user 'test':

    > GRANT write ON factbook TO test

  Note: Local permissions overwrite global permissions. As a consequence, the 'test' user will only be allowed to access (i.e., read and write) the 'factbook' database. If no local permissions are set, the global rights are inherited.

  * Showing global permissions:
   
    > SHOW USERS

  * Showing local permissions on database 'factbook':

   > SHOW USERS ON factbook

  * Dropping of user 'test':

   > DROP USER test

  Further details on user management are to be found in the BaseX Documentation
  Wiki (http://docs.basex.org/wiki/User_Management).
