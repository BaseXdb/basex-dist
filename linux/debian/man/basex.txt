NAME
  basex - XML database system and XPath/XQuery processor (command line mode)

SYNOPSIS
  basex [-diosuvVwz] [-cq] [file]

DESCRIPTION
  basex is a fast and powerful, yet light-weight and platform independent XML
  database system and XPath/XQuery processor.

OPTIONS
  [file]     Execute the specified XQuery file.
  -b<pars>   Bind external variables to XQuery expression. Flag may be specified
             multiple times; key/value pairs are separated by equality signs (=)
             (-bv=example -q"declare variable $v external; $v")
  -c<cmd>    Launch database commands and skip interactive mode.
             The flag should be placed last, as all remaining characters are
             interpreted as commands. Several commands can be separated by 
             semicolons.
  -d         Turn on debugging (to standard error).
  -i<input>  Open a database or XML document specified by the argument.
             The opened input may be further processed by an XQuery expression.
  -o<file>   Command and query output is written to the specified file.
  -q<expr>   Execute the specified string as XQuery expression. The flag should
             be placed last, as all remaining characters are interpreted as
             XQuery.
  -s<pars>   Specify parameters for serializing XQuery results;
             see SERIALIZATION for more details. This flag may be specified
             multiple times; key/value pairs are separated by equality signs (=)
  -u         Modify original files after evaluating XQuery Update expressions
  -v         Process information is written to standard output
  -V         Detailed query information is written to standard output, 
             including compilation and profiling steps.
  -w         By default, whitespaces around text nodes are chopped when a 
             database is created. The flag specifies to suppress chopping.
  -z         Skip the serialization of XQuery results (may be useful for 
             analyzing query plans)

SERIALIZATION
  Serialization parameters define how XQuery items and XML nodes are textually
  output, i.e., serialized. They have been formalized in a W3C XQuery
  Serialization 3.0 document available at http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization-30

  In BaseX, they can be specified in several ways: 
  * by using the -s flag of the BaseX command-line clients,
  * by setting the SERIALIZER option before running a query,
  * by setting the EXPORTER option before exporting a database,
  * by setting them via the Output Parameter of the JAX-RX API,
  * by including them in the prolog of the XQuery expression (since XQuery 3.0), or
  * by specifying them in the XQuery function file:write().

  An extensive documentation of all serialization parameters is to be found on:
  http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Serialization

  An example would be:

    method=xml,encoding=CP1252

EXAMPLES
  * XQuery evaluation (no database, no interaction, script mode):

   $ basex -q 19+23
   42
   $ basex -q "<answer>{ 23+19 }</answer>"
   <answer>42</answer>

  * Import an XML file into database, output its content (query its root) and be verbose:

    $ basex -Vc "CREATE DB input /usr/share/doc/basex/examples/input.xml; XQUERY /"
    Database 'input' created in 53.64 ms.

  * Retrieve XML from the web and perform XPath query: 

    $ basex -q "doc('https://svn.uni-konstanz.de/dbis/basex/tags/6.5/basex/etc/xml/input.xml')//li"
    <li>Exercise 1</li>

  * W3C XQuery Full-Text (make use of full-text index and perform fuzzy query with a typing error):

    $ basex
    BaseX 6.5 [Standalone]
    Try "help" to get more information.
